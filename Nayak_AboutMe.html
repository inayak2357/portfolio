                                <div>Hello and welcome to my website! My name 
                                is Isha Nayak, a freshman at Dublin High School.
                                I am interested in going into the engineering 
                                field as a 3D animator. 
                                </p>

                <p>I am currently taking the elective course Computer Science 
                Principles and I hope to broaden my knowledge and interests 
                in the engineering field by taking courses outside of this 
                course. 
                A few of the websites I use for self learning include 
                w3schools.com and Codecademy.
                </p>

                <p>One of the careers I am drawn to is 3D animation since I have an interest in 
                drawing. 
                I love to draw and the many aspects of the creative process involved in drawing.
                For example, because of this interest I have taken Khan Academy courses about
                what shading artists at Pixar do through the partnership between Khan Academy 
                and Pixar in a Box. I look forward to learning and furthering my interest in
                3D animation, and also look forward to working with others.
                </p>

                <p>Over the years I have learned that friends and teammates provide strong support 
                and through good communication and loyalty projects/assignments can get done
                more efficiently. 
                In middle school I was a part of a club called the California Junior 
                Scholarship Federation where I project managed the Animals and Environment 
                project group. 
                I played a big part in organizing a popsicle fundraiser to raise money for the 
                Hurricane Harvey victims where we raised over $500 for the victims of the
                Hurricane Harvey. 
                Through the fundraiser I learned about working with others and communicating 
                the dates through flyers and emails. 
                I also learned about planning to keep the fundraiser in order.
                </p>

                <p>In addition to self-learning and being a team player, I believe  being creative 
                is crucial to success. 
                While I learn a lot through my classes and teammates at school, I continue to 
                apply my skills whenever possible. 
                In the past I have created flyers for fundraisers for the Animals and 
                Environment Project Group for CJSF (California Junior Scholarship Federation).
                </p>
