                                    <div>Hello and welcome to my website! 
                                    My name is Isha Nayak, a freshman at 
                                    Dublin High School.
                                    I am interested in going into the engineering 
                                    field as either a 3D animator or 
                                    software engineer. 
                                </p>

                <p>I am currently taking the elective course Computer Science 
                Principles and I hope to broaden my knowledge and interests 
                in the engineering field by taking courses outside of this 
                course. 
                A few of the websites I use for self learning include 
                w3schools.com and Codecademy.
                </p>

                <p>One of the careers I am drawn to is 3D animation since 
                I have an interest in drawing. 
                I love to draw and the many aspects of the creative process 
                involved in drawing.
                For example, because of this interest I have taken Khan Academy
                courses about what shading artists at Pixar do through the 
                partnership between Khan Academy and Pixar in a Box. 
                I look forward to learning and furthering my interest in
                3D animation, and also look forward to working with others.
                </p>

                <p>Over the years I have learned that friends and teammates 
                provide strong support and through good communication and 
                loyalty projects/assignments can get done more efficiently. 
                I am currently a part of the Technical Theater Club, the Give 
                Light Club, and the California Scholarship Federation (CSF) at 
                Dublin High School.
                </p>

                <p>In addition to self-learning and being a team player, 
                I believe  being creative is crucial to success. 
                While I learn a lot through my classes and teammates at school,
                I continue to apply my skills whenever possible. 
                In the past I have created flyers for fundraisers for the 
                Animals and Environment Project Group for CJSF 
                (California Junior Scholarship Federation).
                </p> 

                <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me, 
                please feel free to explore the rest of my website.
