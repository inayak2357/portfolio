                    My partner, Brian, and I were given an 
                    introduction and then our instructions on the

animation
</a> to make our scratch game/story.
                                Working on the Scratch project, I learned about 
                                the logic involved in coding; using blocks, 
                                we are able to manipulate sprites and the 
                                different elements including background and 
                                sounds. 
                                I learned too that commenting can help a lot 
                                with figuring out which code does what when 
                                a piece of code breaks. 
                                For someone who had no background in coding, 
                                I realized that perseverance is important. 
                                Working in pairs, our story/game that we 
                                created for the project included a lot of 
                                sprites and scene changes and we found it hard 
                                to code for each movement. 
                                Besides working hard to learn how to code, 
                                it was equally important to learn to work and 
                                communicate well with a team mate.

For the Image Manipulation Project after we were given our

    instructions
</a>,we brainstormed our ideas for the project. After getting some inspiration 
from the internet on some things we could do we narrowed down our ideas and made
a drawing of our idea. We then set out to find stock free images and worked on 
changing the pixel colors of the image. After we got the code to work we played 
around with the colors and worked on adding borders and images for logos. While 
working on the Image Manipulation Project I learned how to solve by trying and 
to not be afraid of making mistakes while coding and trying to create new 
things. I also learned how to make my documentation simpler, cleaner, and 
professional. My teammate and I worked well together, collaborating over chats 
on weekends and after school.
