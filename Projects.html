                                programming 
                                language. 
                                Working on the Scratch project, I learned about 
                                the logic involved in coding; using blocks, 
                                we are able to manipulate sprites and the 
                                different elements including background and 
                                sounds. 
                                I learned too that commenting can help a lot 
                                with figuring out which code does what when 
                                a piece of code breaks. 
                                For someone who had no background in coding, 
                                I realized that perseverance is important. 
                                Working in pairs, our story/game that we 
                                created for the project included a lot of 
                                sprites and scene changes and we found it hard 
                                to code for each movement. 
                                Besides working hard to learn how to code, 
                                it was equally important to learn to work and 
                                communicate well with a team mate. Here is our
                                documentation that we did as we worked on our 
                                project.

                                    The App Inventor Project helped me learn 
                                patience since many of the features that my 
                                partner and I thought of did not work with 
                                App Inventor. After many trials and errors and 
                                searching up ways to help solve the problem we 
                                found that the feature did not work and found 
                                another way to make the game harder and more 
                                interesting. 
                                I also learned about making my documentation 
                                easier to read and organized so it looks 
                                more professional.
