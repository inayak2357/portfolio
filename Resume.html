          One of the activities I enjoy is running. 
          In 8th grade (as well as in 6th grade) I was in track and field. 
          I also swim and play badminton. 
          I have also taught myself how to longboard. 
          Outside of sports, I devote some time on learning Korean using an app
          on my phone as well as from a book. 
          I am more familiar with the Korean characters and can read some words.
          I also play the piano and have received the Piano Merit Test 
          Certification for 5 consecutive years. 
          I have also received the honor roll all 4 quarters in my 8th grade 
          year at Fallon Middle School. 
          During my 8th grade year, I was also in a club where I mentored 6th 
          graders who were struggling in some classes. 
          We met once or twice a week to go over some lessons. 
          We would also help them keep track of missing assignments, quizzes, 
          and tests.

        <p class="card-text">While I have yet to decide on a specific career, 
        there are a few careers that I am interested in exploring while in 
        high school. 
        I am interested in potentially becoming any of these: a 3D animator, 
        an environmental engineer, a software programmer, or a zoologist. 
        Though the last job seems quite different from the rest, I believe that 
        all of these jobs will need coding skills. 
        By taking this Project Lead the Way course I hope to not only learn and
        better my skills in programming, but narrow down my career choices to
        find one I would be the most interested and best fitted for when I 
        finally go to college.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title"><font color="5680E9">Skills</font></h5>
        <p class="card-text">I am creative and have experience using softwares 
        like Procreate for drawing. 
        I also have some coding skills and can write in HTML, Python, and CSS. 
        Although I donâ€™t have extensive experience in any one particular 
        language, I believe that with hard work, I can acquire the skills. 
        I am learning more about coding through Codecademy and a coding app 
        called Mimo.

        <h5 class="card-title"><font color="5680E9">Volunteer Experience</font></h5>
        <p class="card-text">In middle school I was a member of the California 
        Scholarship and participated in a popsicle fundraiser, two flea 
        markets, Spoken Word Night, Fallon Night Live, and track meet 
        fundraisers. 
        So far, in my freshman year I have created blessings for backpacks for 
        a club called Students Taking Active Roles Club. 
        I have also created a poster for the Give Light Club and have 
        volunteered at Fertile GroundWorks.
